# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a macOS-focused MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed for intelligent file system operations. The project is in early development stages.

## Development Environment

Based on the .gitignore configuration, this project is set up for macOS/iOS development with support for:
- Swift/Objective-C development
- Xcode project files
- Swift Package Manager
- CocoaPods (if needed)
- Carthage (if needed)

## Repository Structure

Currently minimal - contains only foundational files:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `LICENSE` - MIT license
- `.gitignore` - Configured for macOS/iOS development

## Development Commands

Since the project is in early stages, no build/test commands are available yet. Common commands will be added as the project develops.

## Architecture Notes

The project aims to create an MCP server specifically optimized for macOS file system operations. Detailed architecture information will be added as the codebase develops.

## Future Development

When source code is added, update this file to include:
- Build and test commands
- Project structure and key components
- Development setup instructions
- Architecture details
